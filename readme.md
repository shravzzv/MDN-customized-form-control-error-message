# Customized error message using the Constraint Validation API

The automated error messages for form controls have two drawbacks:

- There is no standard way to change their look and feel with CSS.
- They depend on the browser locale, which means that you can have a page in one language but an error message displayed in another language.

Customizing these error messages is one of the most common use cases of the Constraint Validation API.
